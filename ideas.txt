Completely changed my idea to a light scepter as the weapon.
But the notes and thought process is here:


The game:
- side scroller
- gravity as your weapon
- you can throw enemies at (spikes?) to kill them
- THE GOAL?
- use gravity to divert projectiles back at enemies who shot them
- constant controll mode to steer (projectiles?) at something?


====================================

Type (just ideas):
- top-down
- side-scroller
- tower defense
- many characters (thing GTA V) (maybe)

Contradictions: (we don't want those)
- regular gun
- magic/skill
- any kind of projectile
- portal gun

Ideas:
- Tower defense
  '- indirect control - some kind of traps, latches, switches, trapdoors,
     releasing your own guards, animals, etc
- abstract idea?
- - time - kill enemies with passing time; hide n seek maybe?
- water
- neighbors from hell - main char uses trick to piss of his neighbors
- kill with laughter
- use the Internet as a weapon
- eyesight / staring contest / look at something for long time to kill it
  '- Mario type game with enemies attacking you only when you're not looking
- light?
- economic warfare?
- rat explosive (stick C4 up a rat's butt)
- touch to destroy
- room explorer, small missions, use Internet (minigames) to exploit the world
- slowed time as your skill/ability and that being your weapon
- hologram to attract enemie's attention (or any other reason)
- gravity
- cheating to pass a test
  '- clarvionce / agility would be your weapon
