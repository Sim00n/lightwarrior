# Light Warrior

#### The Game

Light Warrior is platformer game where the goal is to complete all levels while collecting as many coins as possible. The levels get darker as you go and traps are placed in less obvious spots, therefor you have to use your special weapon - a light scepter. It allows you to illuminate the area with a powerful beam of light for a period of 5 seconds. After that the scepter will go on cooldown for another 5 seconds. 

While playing avoid spikes which kill you instantly, as well as a exploding barrels which damage you for 25HP. Remember that you have a limited amount of lives, but there are potatoes that you can pick up to gain more lives. When you die, you spawn back at the beginning of the current level, unless you ran out of lives in which case you have to begin the game from the start.


#### My Experience

This was my second Ludum Dare, and as always (even when spectating) I've had a ton of fun. My goal for this round was to learn LibGDX which I did and feel very accomplished. I was also streaming at the same time, and I've had a few lurkers which is always nice on top of my friends watching. 


#### Controls

I know that the movement is very unsatisfactory, but you can take an advantage of that when you play by sticking to walls, jumping when there's no ground below you, and few other bugs. 

To control the character use WSAD. 
To use your light scepter hit SPACE. 
Remember that you can regulate sound levels in the menu which you access with ESC. 


#### Technologies used

I've used Java with the LibGDX library. Included in that I've used Box2D and Box2DLights. I made my graphics using Paint.NET and have put levels together using Tiled with a little bit of coding magic in Java. My sound effects were made using the good'ol SFXR and my music was surprisingly simple to make with some iOS apps. IDE was Eclipse and streaming with OBS.
